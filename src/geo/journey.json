We dropped anchor off <u>Dromana</u>, waiting as so many sailing ships had done before, for the ebb tide to take us down early next morning to the <u>Heads</u>, so that we could pass through them at slack water."

The mist cleared and we could see the <u>Heads</u>, and as soon as we were on the right bearing we turned to run out. As we passed the signal station at <u>Point Lonsdale</u> we saw the signal for the tides change from the last quarter to the first quarter; it was exactly slack water and there was no ripple on the surface. On the port hand there was the black and red rusting hull of a steamer wrecked on the shoals, and ahead the sails of two yachts. As soon as we were through we stopped the engine and got up sail ourselves, but the wind was very light from the south and we made very slow progress on the port tack."
