# Once Is Enough

A visualization of the journey from the book "Once is Enough".

> _“I have called this story Once is Enough, but once is never really enough in any worthwhile sport. The mountaineer coming down from a high mountain may look over his shoulder and say, ‘Well that’s that. Never again!’ But no sooner is he down at the base camp than he is wondering whether another route will ‘go’. The same with a yacht and Cape Horn. Once, or twice, may be enough for Beryl and me and Tzu Hang, but certain it is that other yachts will still try it. Some will be successful, and some like us will fail. It isn’t a trip to be undertaken lightly, however good the ship, and the story of our passage and the experience of what might happen to a yacht like Tzu Hang in those big seas, may add its little molecule to the mountains of knowledge of ships and the sea.”_ - Miles Smeeton

All coordinates, pathes and distances are replicated as closely as possible but may be inaccurate. Path lines are derived from the pictures at the beginning of each chapter.
